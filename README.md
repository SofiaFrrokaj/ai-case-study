# DEEPGRAM AI
Deepgram is Revolutionizing Human Machine Communication with Advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
## Overview and Origin
This case study explains how Deepgram was created to revolutionize human machine communication by performing real time human voice AI understanding and recognition through Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology.  Karan Mahandru and Scott Stephenson cofounded Deepgram on August 18, 2015. Deepgram’s ASR technology has significantly advanced text-to-speech, transcription and audio intelligence.   ASR technology assists businesses to enhance human voice interactions.  Through ASR technology various businesses in a wide range of industries noticed significant improvements in transcription quality and operational efficiency. The idea for Deepgram came about through machine learning research performed by waveform analysis in a dark matter detector in China.  During the exploration of deep learning audio analysis at the University of Michigan, a gap in the speech to text market was discovered leading the cofounders to create Deepgram’s end to end deep learning technology. Initial Y Combinator and other seed funding began in 2016. Series A funding raised $12M dollars.  Series B funding was raised to $25M in 2020, followed by a Series B Extension in the amount of $72M in 2022.
